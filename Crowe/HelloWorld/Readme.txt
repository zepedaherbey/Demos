Build application
Open a console application and "CD" to Demos\Crowe\HelloWorld\Client\bin\Debug
Run the application by typing : "Client" and then hitting enter

IMPORTANT
If the application is not running you might have to change the url in Client.Program.cs.

To do this right click on the WebApi project and select debug. A web browser should pop up.
Copy the uri string and replace the following substring in Program.cs 
http://localhost:52035/

with whatever value you have copied.
